# Introducing Ar(chitecture of)Du(plications)
**Please bear with us as this readme -like ArDu- is still a Work In Progress**

ArDu is a tool designed to screen target loci for genomic duplications, provide estimates of their copy number, and identify their genetic architecture (i.e. breakpoints, copy numbers, secondary rearrangements). As it is entirely written in Python, it should run on pretty much any machine and it should be modular and easy to modify to accommodate the users specific needs. 
ArDu depends on a few Python packages that can be found in the `.yml` file available in the main branch of the Git repository.

## Gene Copy Number Estimates

ArDu uses information from BAM alignment files to estimate a target loci copy number. The target's depth of coverage is normalised by a user-provided reference loci. Depending on the reference used, this normalised depth can be directly used a a copy number proxy (Claret et al. 2023), see best practises.

### Word of Caution and best practises 

The choice of reference used for normalisation is critical to the quality of the copy number estimate. A wide range of genomic intervals can be used as reference, from whole chromosomes to a single housekeeping gene. However, we have seen an improvement in estimation precision by using exonic sequences of a housekeeping gene. WIP: An upcoming version will allow a less crude normalisation method through the use of targeted interval normalisation.
There are many copy number variant annotation tools that work on a genome-wide scale, but ArDu is specifically designed around a candidate locus approach, while you can use it on a large number of targets or even the entirety of an assembly annotation, it is not its intended use (expect long run times and little usability in the results).

| **Breakpoints Detection**  |
| `--breakpoint`        | Optional: assess putative breakpoints. Two methods are available: 'ruptures' and 'rollingaverage'. <br> 'ruptures' uses the ruptures python package (see https://centre-borelli.github.io/ruptures-docs/). Associated options are --bkp_model, --bkp_pen or --bkp_nb. <br> 'rollingaverage' uses successive rolling average to detect shifts in depth of coverage. Associated options are --bkp_slw, --bkp_threshold, and --bkp_passes. <br> Setting this argument will create a '.breakpoints.tsv' output file containing the positions found by the rupture package, or the regions with depth of coverage shifting found with 'rollingaverage'. | `None`                               |
| `--bkp_slw`           | Window size for ruptures model and rolling average calculation. Default= 1 kb.                                          | `1000`                               |
| `--bkp_nb`            | Number of expected breakpoints in this structure, cannot be used alongside --bkp_pen.                                   | `None`                               |
| `--bkp_pen`           | Penalty parameter for ruptures algo.predict. A higher value will result in a higher penalty in breakpoint creation. Use this option if you don't have a prior on the breakpoint number in the structure you're looking at. | `None`                               |
| `--bkp_model`         | Model used by ruptures package. Default = 'l2'. Please refer to ruptures's documentation to see which options are best fitting to your specific case.                                                                         | `l2`                                 |
| `--bkp_algo`          | Algorithm used by ruptures package. Default = 'Window'.                                                                  | `Window`                             |

| `--bkp_passes`        | Number of rolling average passes. Increasing will lessen the overall variation in depth of coverage.                   | `1`                                  |
| **Genotyping**        |                                                                                                                        |                                      |
| `--mutation`          | Optional: If set, this option will return the number of reads supporting each nucleotide at the given position(s) in a `.mutation.tsv` file. Takes as input a tab-delimited file formated as follows: <br>`chromosome   position  mutation_name(optional)`. | `None`                               |
